title: PM 2.5 Emissions / Year / Sq Mile
...

These maps show PM 2.5 emissions by county across the United States from 1999 to
2008. You can read about the data here: [Clearinghouse for Inventories &
Emissions Factors][1] and download the data here: [Data.][2]

I also pulled data from the Census Bureau website that showed the number of
square miles in each county in the country from the Census Bureau TIGER
database.

I did the work in R and figured out how to do the mapping from this post showing
how to map unemployment rate by county. [Choropleths in R][3]
