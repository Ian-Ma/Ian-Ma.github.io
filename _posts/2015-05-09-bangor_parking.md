title: Bangor Parking Policy
...

This is just an op-ed that I wrote about Bangor Maine's parking policy. I have a lot of interests including urban planning and design.



>When you find an empty parking space with no meter, the space seems free. [But parking spaces are expensive][2]. They are paid for with a lot of government money and hidden costs. The [average cost of each new on-street parking space is $1,750][3]; on average, each space in a [parking garage costs $15,000][5]; and underground parking costs [between $30,000 and $50,000 per space][4]. Annual maintenance for each parking space ranges between $200 and $800 per space, and additional costs include debt service, staffing, security, insurance and snow removal.
